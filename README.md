   Using Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF) and C#, I managed  to create a software application aiming at facilitating the process of sending multiple email messages to recipients’ addresses imported from CSV files, along with other relevant 
information, in order to customise each subject and body fields, if that’s what the user wishes.

   Both email subject and body are written only once and strings like “{1}”,”{2}” are used within, so that one can indicate 
which CSV column values should replace them, during the process of sending the messages, resulting in the customisation 
I have already mentioned.
